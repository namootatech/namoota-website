I get asked a lot how I ship client sites so fast without sacrificing quality. Here's the exact workflow I use - no gatekeeping, just the stack and the steps.

TL;DR: I use an AI agent to generate a v0-ready prompt from the client's basics, then I feed that into Vercel v0. In 5 minutes or less v0 gives me a full site. I add a custom domain and deploy. Total time: 10-20 minutes from brief to live.

## What you need from the client (and what to do if you don't have it)

Before anything else, I need three things:

1. Business name
2. Industry (e.g. restaurant, law firm, salon, gym, NPO)
3. Short description - what they do, who they serve, tone (professional, casual, premium, etc.)

If the client hasn't sent a description, I either:

- Use whatever they did send (email, WhatsApp brief, one-pager), or
- Generate one with Gemini or Grok: I paste the business name + industry and ask for a 2-3 sentence "About" blurb suitable for a website hero or About section. Takes under a minute.

Once I have name, industry, and description, I'm ready for the next step.

## Step 1: Generate the v0 prompt with the Agent.ai agent

I don't write the v0 prompt from scratch. I use the Vercel v0 Website Prompt Generator on Agent.ai.

- I open the agent, then feed it:
  - Website/business name
  - Industry
  - About/description (the one from the client or the one I generated with Gemini/Grok)

The agent returns a ready-made prompt (plus context) that's tuned for v0 - the kind of structure and wording that gets v0 to produce a coherent, on-brand site instead of a generic template.

That's the whole job of this step: input = name + industry + description -> output = v0-ready prompt.

## Step 2: Paste into v0.dev and generate

1. I open v0.dev and start a new chat
2. I paste the prompt from the Agent.ai agent
3. I paste the description (or the same "About" text) so v0 has the exact copy
4. I hit Generate

In 5 minutes or less, v0's AI has usually produced a full landing/marketing site: hero, sections, layout, and styling (Tailwind/shadcn-style components). I review it, maybe ask for one or two tweaks in the same chat (e.g. "make the CTA button blue" or "add a testimonials section"), then I'm ready to move on.

## Step 3: Custom domain and deploy

- I add the client's custom domain in the v0/Vercel project (or in the linked Vercel project if I've exported the code)
- I deploy - Vercel's default flow is push or "Deploy" from v0; I make sure the production branch is set and the domain is connected
- DNS is pointed (A/CNAME as per Vercel's instructions). Once propagation is done, the site is live

All done. From "here's my business name and industry" to a live, good-looking, fully functional client website in 10-20 minutes - with most of that time being prompt generation, review, and domain/DNS, not manual coding.

## Why this works

- v0 is built for generating production-ready React/Next-style UIs from a good prompt
- The Agent.ai prompt generator turns loose client info into that "good prompt" so I don't have to trial-and-error in v0
- Gemini or Grok fills the gap when the client doesn't provide a description, so I always have something solid to feed the agent and v0
- Vercel keeps deploy and custom domains simple, so "go live" is literally a few clicks after the UI is ready

I've used this for restaurants, salons, small practices, NPOs, and local businesses. It's not for every project (e.g. heavy e-commerce or complex apps), but for marketing/landing sites and simple client sites it's my default. Fast, professional, and repeatable.

If you try the same stack - Agent.ai prompt generator -> v0 -> Vercel + custom domain - I'd love to hear how it goes or what you'd add. Drop a comment or reply with your own tweaks.
